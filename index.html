        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: <strong>[Date]</strong></p>

        <p>We at <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong> respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information from users of the <strong>[Your Extension Name]</strong> Chrome extension (referred to as “the extension”).</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information from users of the extension. The extension operates entirely on your local device and does not transmit or store any data on external servers or databases.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions Justification</h2>
        <p>The extension requires the following permissions to function properly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: This permission is necessary to access the current webpage so that the extension can extract links from the content you are viewing. We do not store or transmit any data related to your browsing activity.</li>
            <li><strong>downloads</strong>: This permission is used to allow users to download the extracted links as a text file for offline use. The extension only generates the file locally on your device and does not send the file to any external server.</li>
            <li><strong>storage</strong>: The storage permission is used to locally save user preferences and settings (if applicable). These settings are stored only on your local machine and are not shared with us or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>host permissions</strong>: The extension requires host permissions to access the content of the page you are viewing and extract the links. This permission is strictly used for the intended functionality of extracting links and does not involve tracking or collecting browsing data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, share, or sell any personal data. The data processed by the extension (such as the links extracted from a webpage) is only handled locally on your device and is never transmitted to any third-party servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Remote Code Use</h2>
        <p>The extension does not use or execute any remote code. All code is packaged within the extension and runs entirely within your local browser environment.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated revision date. By continuing to use the extension, you agree to this policy and any future updates.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or the use of your information, feel free to contact us at <strong>[your email address]</strong>.</p>

        <p>By using <strong>[Your Extension Name]</strong>, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please uninstall the extension.</p>
